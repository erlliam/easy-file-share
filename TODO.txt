I want to be able to transfer files between my computers. I don't want to sign into anything. I don't want to plug anything in.

I picture a simple web server I can connect on my local network. I should be able to drag and drop files and they should show up right away.

I will have the option to download/copy to clipboard/compress these files.

File compression will come in handy for sharing media via Discord.

There should be an option to add authentication.

I also would like to host a demo for some sort of portfolio site
